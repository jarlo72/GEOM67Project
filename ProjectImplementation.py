# Program function: Calculates the depth below the surface using radiolocation
# Farrant, Andrew & Mullan, Graham. (2018). Novel use of radio-location for a ground investigation at Pen Park Hole, Bristol, United Kingdom
# Uses the distance the receiver is from ground zero and angle of the receiver 
# Assumes the angle of the receiver is in degrees and that the coordinates for Ground Zero and the Receiver's location is referencing a cartesian plane using metric(meter) units.
# Inputs entered with keyboard
# Outputs displayed on screen

# Structure of implementation follows the algorithm
